// I learned that you can use brackets [] to assign the nth character of a variable to another variable.  Note: counting starts at 0.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
