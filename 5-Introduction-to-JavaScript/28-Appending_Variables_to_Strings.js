// I learned that you can use the += to append some previously named variable to a string.

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "super special awesome!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective
